# Rialo Identity Generator

Fan-made tool for the Rialo community during Phase 2.

This small web app generates a fun, unofficial "Rialo Member Card" with:

- Identity (your alias or a randomly generated one)
- Role (e.g. Explorer, Builder, Strategist)
- Vibe (e.g. DeFi degen, quiet builder)
- Affinity (e.g. automation, cross-chain workflows)

> Not an official role system. Just for fun and community vibes.

## How to Use

1. Open the website.
2. (Optional) Type your name / alias.
3. Click **"Generate Identity"**.
4. Share your result with friends or in the community.
